    <p>NFL is a lot of fun but I don't watch a lot.<br>
    When I watch it's the Chiefs or Cowboys.<br>
    I enjoy hanging out with friends while watching.</p>
    <p>But this email is to encourage you to watch.<br>
    Post pictures of your gameday watch parties and tag NFL!
    You'll win a prize. :) </p>
    <p>The prize will be VIP field passes for you and 3 of your friends.<br>
    But you have to wear masks cause Covid.<br>
    And you have to cheer for the team we tell you to cheer for.</p>
